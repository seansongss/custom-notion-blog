## Intro

This project is on live with my personal website [seansongss.com](https://seansongss.com).

The project uses [Notion](https://www.notion.so) as a CMS, [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

This project is heavily inspired by the [Next.js Notion Starter Kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit) for its structure and [Bepyan](https://bepyan.me/en/) for its styling. A huge thanks to both projects for their incredible contributions and ideas!

## üåü Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches blog data from Notion, with each row in the Notion table representing an article.
- **Easy Content Management**: Since this uses Notion as CMS, posts and categories can easily be tracked through Notion.
- **Category-Based Organization**: Automatically categorizes posts, with each category represented as a tab on the blog.
- **SEO Friendly**: Optimized for search engines, making your blog posts discoverable on Google and other search engines.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

### Site Configuration

1. Set up environment variables with provided `template.env`:
    1. Follow instruction from [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x?tab=readme-ov-file#private-pages) for setting `NOTION_ACTIVE_USER` (= `notion_user_id`) and `NOTION_TOKEN_V2` (= `token_v2`)

    2. Set up new integration at [Notion API Integration](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and link to template page:
        - Go to your blog page in Notion and connect to your api integration
![Notion API Connection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a3e40a7-9426-4018-99ff-27ac2058ab09)

    3. Generate secret key and edit button link in Notion page and set `REVALIDATE_SECRET_KEY`:
        - ```openssl rand -base64 32``` can be used for generating simple secret key

2. Set up `site.config.ts`
    1. Duplicate [Notion Blog Template](https://successful-mayflower-d05.notion.site/Blog-Template-1086cdce0ccf80809897f8d9c8c9e500) to get started.

    2. Copy database id to `site.config.ts`.
        - Copy two database id that can be retrieved by clicking database name, and extract first part of URL before ?v= which looks like `1463156cc7094bfea3d7933d865ebfa7`.
        - `notionDatabaseId` is Blog database (articles) and `notionCategoryDatabaseId` is Category Description database.
